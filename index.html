        <p>Canada is home to the Rocky Mountains, some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. Once you've
            had your fill of hiking, skiing, or snowboarding in these gorgeous mountains, the next logical step is to
            sniff out the closest restaurant selling poutine and watch a hockey game. </p>
